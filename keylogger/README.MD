## Keylogger Implementation Project (Educational Purposes Only)

**Disclaimer:** This project demonstrates the functionality of a basic keylogger for educational purposes only. **Creating or using keyloggers for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.** 

**Project Overview:** This repository explores the implementation of a basic keylogger using Python. 

## Educational Value

**What is a keylogger?**

Keyloggers are malicious software that secretly record keystrokes, posing a significant threat to user data security.

**Key Features of a keylogger**

* **Real-time Keystroke Logging:** Captures keystrokes as they are pressed on the keyboard.
* **Log File Creation:** Stores captured keystrokes in a designated file for later analysis.

**How Keyloggers Work**

* **Software-based keyloggers:** These are installed on a device without the user's knowledge. They can be disguised as legitimate applications or bundled with other software.
* **Hardware keyloggers:** These are physical devices that can be inserted between a keyboard and computer. They capture keystrokes directly from the hardware.

**Detecting Keyloggers**

* **Unusual system behavior:** Look for signs like slow performance, unresponsive applications, or strange network activity.
* **Unknown processes:** Check the task manager for unfamiliar or suspicious processes running in the background.
* **Suspicious files:** Scan your system for unusual files or folders, especially in the startup or system directories.
* **Antivirus software:** Keep your antivirus software up-to-date and run regular scans.
* **Network monitoring:** Use network monitoring tools to detect suspicious network traffic.
